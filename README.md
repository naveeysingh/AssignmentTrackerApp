## Project Description

The **Assignment Tracker App** is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, and HBS as the templating engine. This app allows usersâ€”particularly studentsâ€”to:

- Add new assignments
- Edit existing assignments
- Delete completed assignments
- View all current assignments in a clean, organized list
- Search assignments using keywords
- Receive visual notifications upon task updates via flash messages

## Purpose of the Application

This application is designed to support students in managing their academic workload more efficiently. With clear visibility into their upcoming tasks and deadlines, students can prioritize work, avoid missing submissions, and reduce stress related to academic responsibilities.

## Why is This Application Useful?

By organizing assignments with details like titles, questions/descriptions, deadlines, and statuses, the app:

- Enhances time management
- Prevents assignment loss/forgetfulness
- Improves productivity and mental clarity

## Additional Feature

An advanced **search functionality** is included that allows users to find specific assignments by keywords. This is powered using MongoDBâ€™s built-in text indexing. Additionally:

- **Flash messages** using `connect-flash` and `express-session` are integrated to notify users about successful creation, updates, and deletion.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend:** HTML5, HBS (Handlebars), Bootstrap 5
- **Other Packages:** dotenv, connect-flash, express-session, body-parser

## Styling Approach

The app uses the **Bootstrap framework** to ensure a responsive and modern UI, allowing faster development of a clean and accessible layout without deep CSS knowledge.
